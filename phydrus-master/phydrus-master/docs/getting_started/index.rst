Getting started with Phydrus
============================
In this section you can find guidance on how to get started with Phydrus.
Before being able to run a Phydrus model from Python Console you need to 1)
install the Phydrus package, and 2) obtain a compiled version of the Hydrus-1D
Fortran code. After you have succesfully completed these two steps, you can
start creating your first Phydrus model. The final section will help to get
you started by explaining the modeling approach applied in Phydrus.
